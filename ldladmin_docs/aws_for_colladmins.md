## Creating an AWS Account for Collection Admins (as a SysAdmin)

See [Amazon's Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html?icmpid=docs_iam_console#id_users_create_console)

1. Choose Users, then Add user.
1. Enter a user name, preferably corresponding to their Islandora user name.
1. Select AWS Management Console access, autogenerate a password, and require password reset.
1. Add the user to the group ldl-collection-admins  
1. Create the user and make note of the user name and password, to send in an email.
