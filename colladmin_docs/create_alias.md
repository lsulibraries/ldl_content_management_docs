# Create a Collection Alias

When creating a new collection, an LDL Collection Administrator must create a collection alias. Each collection's alias must be unique.  

The collection alias will form part of the URL for the collection and all of the items within it; it will be the __namespace__ for the collection. The Andrew Augustus Gunby Photograph Collection, with URL `http://www.louisianadigitallibrary.org/islandora/object/ulm-p16313coll1:collection`, has the collection alias or namespace __"ulm-p16313coll1"__.  

Collection aliases consist of two components, separated by a hyphen:  

1. Institution code
2. Collection code

The PID for the collection home page will follow the format *institution code, hyphen, collection code, colon, "collection"*

* Example: loyno-p16313coll24:collection

### Institution Code  

Each LDC member institution has a unique Institution Code. LDL user accounts are affiliated with one or more Institution Codes. An LDL user may only create collections using an institution code with which they are affiliated.

### Collection Code

Collection codes should be alphanumeric, lowercase, reasonably logical, and easy to remember.

* Use only numbers and lowercase letters in the collection code.
* _Do not enter a hyphen_ as part of your collection code, as the portion of the alias preceding the hyphen will be interpreted as a new "sub-institution."

_Note:_ A Collection Administrator who creates a new sub-institution by accident *will not have access* to manage that collection, as the sub-institution will not be affiliated with their account! Contact an LSU Site Admin if you find yourself in this situation.
